        Main Establishment: The primary location of the employer that files this application on behalf of all its associated work sites. (There can only be one main establishment.)

        Branch Establishments: A branch establishment is a physically separate work site that is part of the same organization as the main establishment.

        Off-Site Work Location: An off-site work location is a work site typically on the premises of a separate establishment, where workers with disabilities, or a group of workers with disabilities, are placed in work settings along with job coaches (staff of the rehabilitation or work center).

            Provide the average (mean) number of hours per week the employee worked on all jobs at this work site during the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Calculate this by taking the total number of hours the employee worked during the most recently completed three-month fiscal quarter and dividing by the number of weeks in the quarter (13 weeks). For example: 260 hours worked in the quarter ÷ 13 weeks per quarter = 20 hours per week average.

            Average earnings are computed by dividing the total earnings of the individual worker by the total number of hours worked during the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Note: The total number of hours worked should only include the compensable work time (for example, generally would not include time spent in rehabilitation, therapy, etc.). For example, John Jones earned $900 during the fiscal quarter and he worked 300 hours. $900 ÷ 300 hours = $3.00 per hour, therefore, Mr. Jones’s average earnings per hour are $3.00.

              Average earnings are computed by dividing the total earnings of the individual worker by the total number of hours worked during the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Note: The total number of hours worked should only include the compensable work time (for example, generally would not include time spent in rehabilitation, therapy, etc.). For example, John Jones earned $900 during the fiscal quarter and he worked 300 hours. $900 ÷ 300 hours = $3.00 per hour, therefore, Mr. Jones’s average earnings per hour are $3.00.
