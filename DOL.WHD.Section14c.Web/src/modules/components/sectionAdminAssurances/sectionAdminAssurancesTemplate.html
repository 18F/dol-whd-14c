      <li>Wage rates paid to workers with disabilities under the authority in 29 C.F.R. part 525 are commensurate with those paid experienced workers, who do not have disabilities, in industry in the vicinity for essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work;</li>
      <li>The operations are and will continue to be in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (PCA), the McNamara-Oâ€™Hara Service Contract Act (SCA), and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA), an overtime statute for Federal contract work, as applicable;</li>
