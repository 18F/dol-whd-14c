			<li>Wage rates paid to workers with disabilities under the authority in 29 C.F.R. part 525 are commensurate with those paid
				experienced workers, who do not have disabilities, in industry in the vicinity for essentially the same type, quality,
				and quantity of work;</li>
			<li>The operations are and will continue to be in compliance with the FLSA, PCA, SCA, and Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards
				Act (CWHSSA), an overtime statute for Federal contract work, as applicable;</li>

				six months; and</li>
			<li>Wages paid to all employees under FLSA section 14(c) will be adjusted at periodic intervals, at least once a year, to
