## Application Components

### User Interface

See [DOL.WHD.Section14c.Web Readme](DOL.WHD.Section14c.Web/Readme.md)

| Project | Description     
| --- | ---
DOL.WHD.Section14c.Web | AngularJS front-end

### REST Services

```
| Project | Description     
| --- | ---
DOL.WHD.Section14c.Api | ASP.Net WebAPI REST Services
DOL.WHD.Section14c.Business | .Net Class Library for business services
DOL.WHD.Section14c.Business.Test | MSTest Unit Tests
DOL.WHD.Section14c.Common | .Net Class Libraray for shared coded
DOL.WHD.Section14c.Domain | .Net Class Libarary for entities
DOL.WHD.Section14c.DataAccess | .Net Class Libarary for Entity Framework Context

### Database

The PostgreSQL database used to persist user and 14c application data is generated by Entity Framework Code First Data Migration using the DB2 provider.  The migration includes all required seed data to run the application.

[Migration Configuration](DOL.WHD.Section14c.DataAccess/Migrations/Configuration.cs)

#### System Administrator User Seed

To estblish an intial System Administrator user account the database migration seeds an account for `14c-admin@dol.gov`.  By default this accounts password is expired and must be reset at the first login or through the forgot password flow.

## Deploying

### Conceptual Deployment Model

![Conceptual Deployment Model](docs/ConceptualDeploymentModel.png?raw=true "Conceptual Deployment Model")

### WebDeploy Packages and Build Artifacts

The projects AppVeyor builds generates three web deployment artifacts.  They can be found in the build under the artifacts tab.  As noted in the conceptual deployment model, they can be deployed manually through a [IIS Application Import](https://www.iis.net/learn/publish/using-web-deploy/import-a-package-through-iis-manager) or through the [MSDdeploy command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd569106(v=ws.10).aspx).  For continuous integration settings through AppVeyor see the [appveyor.yml](appveyor.yml)

### 1. DOL.WHD.Section14c.Web.zip
This package contains the front end Web Application.  This is a zip of the WebPack production configuration output found in the /dist folder.  It is not a native WebDeploy package but can be used as one as configured in the AppVeyor Continuous Deployment.

#### Configuration Settings
All configurations for the Web project are set in the env.js. This file is excluded from Continuous Deployment and should be updated manually if needed.

| Setting | Description | Default   
| --- | --- | ---
api_url* | Full URL of the REST API Service | http://localhost:3334 (Local develoment URL)
requireHttps | Use secure cookie | true
tokenCookieDurationMinutes | Token Cookie Expiration in Minutes | 20160 (14 days to match server AccessTokenExpireTimeSpanMinutes)

\* Must be configured during deployment

### 2. DOL.WHD.Section14c.API.zip

This package is a Web the REST Api
#### Configuration Settings
The following are setup as WebDeploy parameters and can be set with command line MSDeploy arguments or manually via a IIS MMC WebDeploy Package Import.  The parameters are setup to transform their respective values in the Web.config file.  An alternate deployment option would be to exclude the Web.config file and set them in an alternate configuration management process.

| Setting | Description | Default   
| --- | --- | ---
ConnectionString* | PostgreSQL database connection string | No Deployment Default
SMTPServer* | SMTP Email Server Address | localhost
SMTPPort* | SMTP Email Server Port | 25
